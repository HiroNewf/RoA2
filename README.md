Should work now... probably

* Go to the releases for the exe version
* Control + 7 is the hotkey to start the loop 

1. Waits 5 seconds when started (in case you aren't tabbed in)
2. Presses right click
3. Waits 3 seconds
4. Presses right click
5. Waits ~3 minutes 
7. Waits 3 seconds
8. Loops back to step 2
