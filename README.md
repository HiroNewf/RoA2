* Control + 7 is the hotkey to start the loop 

1. Waits 5 seconds when started (in case you aren't tabbed in)
2. Presses the desired button
3. Waits 3 seconds
4. Presses the desired button
5. Waits 560 seconds (Ignore the logs saying 500 seconds, I misstyped and can't be bothered to re-compile)
6. Presses the desired button
7. Waits 3 seconds
8. Loops back to step 2
